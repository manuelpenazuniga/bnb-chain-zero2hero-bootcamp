## Solution

### How would you solve the problems of cheating

- The rules of the game can be monitored, movement by movement, by establishing a decentralized network, in which case, after each movement, each player reviews the legality of the movement, the state of the other players and the state of the board in general. If an illegal movement is detected, it will not be approved by consensus and must be retracted, preventing its storage in the history of movements
